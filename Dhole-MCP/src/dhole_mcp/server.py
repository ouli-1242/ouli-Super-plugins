"""Dhole MCP Server.

Forks Scrapling's built-in MCP server and adds:
- Trafilatura article extraction (cleaner than markdownify)
- Smart fetch routing (auto-escalate HTTP -> Stealthy). 2 tiers: HTTP first, then Patchright stealth browser.
- SQLite content cache with TTL
- smart_fetch umbrella tool (single entry point that routes automatically)
- extract_article and extract_structured modes
- Input validation with SSRF protection

Note: the dynamic (Playwright) browser tier was removed in v3.5.0. smart_fetch
auto-routing only uses http -> stealthy; open_session creates a stealthy session.
