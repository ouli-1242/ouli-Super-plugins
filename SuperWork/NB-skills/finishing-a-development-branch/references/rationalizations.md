# Observed Rationalizations and Red Flags (finishing-a-development-branch)

The excuses and failure patterns below were observed defeating this skill's rules. Each is a red flag: catching yourself thinking the left column means the right column is what is actually happening.
Extracted verbatim from the walkthrough variant (`SuperWork`-style agents-skills text) so neither variant loses the counters.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Tests passed earlier this session" | Run the suite on the tree you are about to integrate. A green run only proves the tree it ran on. |
| "They obviously want it merged" | Integration is your human partner's decision. Present the menu and wait. |
| "They seem done with this feature — I'll offer to discard it" | The menu is complete as written. Discard happens only when they ask in so many words. |
| "'Yeah, get rid of it' counts as confirmation" | Only the typed word `discard` authorizes deletion. |
| "The merged-result failure is probably flaky" | A failing merged result stops everything. Branch stays put while you investigate. |
| "The base branch is obviously main" | Confirm the fork point or ask. Merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo. |
| "The push was rejected — force-push will fix it" | A rejected push means the remote moved. Investigate; force-push only on your human partner's explicit request. |
